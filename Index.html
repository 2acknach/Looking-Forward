<h2>Seeing Friends</h2>
<p>As long as quarantine is over i'll be looking forward to hanging out with friends that I havent seen for the last couple months.</p>

<h2>Going shopping</h2>
<p>I despretly need clothes and I hate ordering them online because like 60% of the time they dont fit then I have to go return them and its just a big pain, so i'll be looking forward to shopping at the mall. </p>
  
<h2>Riding Motorcross</h2>
<p>Over the last few months I haven't been able to ride my dirtbike because all the places I like to ride at have been closed so I will be looking forward to that.</p>
